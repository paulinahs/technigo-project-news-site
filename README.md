# 🎨 Musewire

## A modern editorial news site inspired by art, myth, and muses.



**📰 Brief description**

This project was part of Technigo’s first assignment: creating a responsive news site using **HTML and CSS**, with a focus on **layout techniques (Grid and Flexbox)** and **responsive design** for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

My version, **Musewire**, reimagines a cultural magazine where classical muses become modern icons. Each “article” highlights a famous muse—Girl with a Pearl Earring, Ophelia, Frida Kahlo, Echo, Mona Lisa, and Eurydice—through a playful editorial twist.

**🧭 Process & Approach**

I began with pen-and-paper sketches to define the layout, using the **box model** to visualize structure. Then I built the main HTML containers (header, news grid, footer) and styled them with **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for responsiveness.

For the header, I designed a custom frame image with the Musewire logo centered.  
Between the header and news grid, I added a **scrolling ticker banner** for an editorial touch, created purely with **CSS animations** and accessibility in mind (pause on hover and motion-reduction support).

Typography is set in **Poppins** for a clean and modern feel, and the overall design uses soft spacing and neutral tones to keep the focus on the images.
