# News Site

The Technigo selfpaced bootcamp wanted our first prpject to be solely HTML & CSS. And that we should do a news website. 
<br><br> I chose to do one for the renaissance and added lorem ipsum to the articles. <br>
<br>
If I had had more time I would have crafted the "actual content" in the articles as well as provided some "local city editions", just for fun.
